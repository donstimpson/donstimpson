# Hi, I’m Don Stimpson (@donstimpson)

👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I am a researcher with a strong background in computational biology and machine learning. My academic journey includes a Master’s degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology
from the University of Connecticut, where I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, and a Bachelor's degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where I graduated with a 3.32 GPA. Over
the past 7 years, I have accumulated extensive research experience, focusing primarily on computational biochemistry, biophysics, and the application of machine learning to biological phenomena.

## Interests

- **Machine Learning for Biological Applications:** Developing and implementing algorithms to predict and analyze biological phenomena
- **Computational Biology:** Utilizing molecular dynamics, metadynamics, docking simulations, and bioinformatics to understand and predict the behavior of biomolecular systems. This includes
  protein-ligand interactions, protein structure determination, protein dynamics, and the properties of lipid membranes
- **Data Analysis and Optimization:** Applying advanced data processing techniques, including data wrangling, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction, to extract meaningful
  insights from complex biological data.

## Current Learning

🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in advanced machine learning techniques and their applications in computational biology. I have completed the Machine Learning Specialization by 
Stanford University on Coursera and am pursuing the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate.

## Collaboration

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage machine learning to solve complex biological problems. I am particularly interested in projects involving:
- Predictive modeling of protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions and associated features
- Structural analysis of biomolecules using graph neural networks
- Enhanced sampling methods in molecular simulations
